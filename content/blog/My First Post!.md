# Happy to be Done

It took an incredible amount of time today just to get this site to where it's at. I have no clue how the inner workings of this goes. But I love that it seems to just work with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I am very excited to get into doing this whole thing moving forward!!! I get the feeling that I'm going to be playing around with how this site works and learn quite a bit along the way too.

It took a long time just to get the comments working. I promise, I will read every single comment that is made on any of these posts. This is so exciting!!!
