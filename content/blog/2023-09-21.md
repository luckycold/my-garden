# Today's Goals
- [x] Get Home Assistant working

# Thoughts
Current Time: 2:26 PM
This will be a long day, I think.

Current Time: 11:39 PM

Well, I did it, but at what cost? I learned a lot, though. A little hard to describe, but I go over everything I know about Home Assistant here (feel free to skip this part if you want to just go into immediately with what I did today): 
![[Home Assistant]]

The main stuff I worked on today was getting familiar with Home Assistant a bit more. I had already toyed around with it in the past, just trying to get my doorbell to work. But this time, I really wanted to make it a bit more useful. I noticed that it has a sort of "chat assistant" like Google Assistant does. So, I wanted to see how much use I could get out of that. I got it a bit more fleshed out customizing its text-to-speach (tts) engine and some other aspects about it and also set it up on my main server. Well, in the end I was able to get a basic Plex task working by saying **EXACTLY** the words, "Play Luke's Music on Shield". But in spite of the simplicity, it was **really** cool. I was also able to automate getting my doorbell to send me a notification when someone rings the doorbell, along with a quick picture of who is at the door in that notification. 

I can definitely see myself using this a lot more in the future to do even more cool stuff. I saw someone do a video on getting ChatGPT to work with this stuff. I also saw them using something called Node-RED which is like some sort of visual scripting/programming language. Not sure how in-depth I want to get into that.

My long term goal is to make Plex fully work with something like my Google Home setup. So, hopefully I'll be able to get that done in the long run.
