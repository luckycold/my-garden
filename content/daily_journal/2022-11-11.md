I've added Stal 2 to the "Extras" list. :/
Now I'm going to work on doing some programming working through the [[React JS Activity  Notes]] I have for the activities that I need to do.

Current Time: 12:20 AM
This video is really interesting:

The items were some that I knew and some that were actually insightful
1. Eat the frog.
	1. You do it first thing in your list (meaning the morning)
	2. You do the harder one first (Eat the bigger frog)
2. 3-2-1 Rule
	1. Just count down from 3 when you think about doing that particular task. The sheer momentum of counting is typically enough to finally get the task done.
3. Do something
	1. Use your habits that you happen to already have to just do SOMETHING. The moment the process is started the task begins to actually get done.
4. The more chaotic your area, the more chaotic your choices.
	1. Fix these.
5. Focus on the thing you want to do work on and focus on nothing else for 60 seconds.
	1. Breathe deeply as you do it
6. If you feel compelled to be pulled away, make a pressure release using say a 15 minute timer (doesn't have to be this), and just address your distractions. Then, back to the main thing. Do this as a last resort.

This convinced me to use my boredom as a weapon:

I am going to take one of my monitors and set it up either in a different part of the room or somewhere in the living room to focus my focus into a focus. :)
I realized that I felt bored while I was with Alanah's family in San Antonio. Because of this, I genuinely wanted to do my work. So, I think this is a great example of using my boredom as a weapon.

## Are you satisfied with today's plan and why?:
I guess. A little annoying that I rarely get all the items done though.

## Tomorrow's
### Plan:
##### Obligations
- [ ] Check for dishes and do it if you see any

### Feedback:
Cersun - Interesting take on procrastination. I like the 3-2-1 rule in particular. Counting rocks.
