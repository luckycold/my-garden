# Purpose

This page is so that I can understand the ins and outs of how Home Assistant works.

# Overview

Home Assistant fundamentally works by breaking down everything in your house into an object with multiple functions. Those can then be further categorized by rooms. It can help for example make a doorbell which doesn't normally send a thumbnail notification of someone ringing it, to then customize it so that you can. This sort of thing can be done through the automations using some of the sensors and or triggers that an object recognized by Home Assistant has built in from that same object.

# Extended Functionality

The further ability to control your home devices can be added through 3 main areas of Home Assistant.

## Integrations

This is to simply add more devices that are not already recognized by Home Assistant by default. Think of things like Eufy doorbells ([[Dont Buy Eufy Smarthome Stuff]] btw).

## Add-ons

This is more of extending the functionality of the device that's running Home Assistant. Here you can add things like [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), [Plex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_Inc.), and more alternative software that you can run on really any computer.

## HACS

As the way the name seems like it can be pronounced, HACS is extra extensions that go into integrations that are not entirely supported by the Home Assistant development team. Here I actually got the full functionality from my Eufy doorbell so that I can actually see my Eufy doorbell's camera.
